# Shortener

[![Elixir CI](https://github.com/sashashakun/shortener/actions/workflows/default.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sashashakun/shortener/actions/workflows/default.yml)

Here I will do my little tiny URL shortener to practice Elixir, Phoenix and system design.

Deployed to [heroku](https://my-tiny-shortener.herokuapp.com/)

User scenarious I want to cover first:

1. ~I want to set expiration time for short url~
1. ~I want to open original url by short~
1. I want to see my shortened urls (auth?)
1. ~I want to see how much people opened my url~
